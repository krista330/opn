Using Azure Firewall in an Azure Virtual Network impacts the system in the following ways:

1. Security Enhancement
Traffic Control: Allows rule-based filtering of network traffic.
Threat Protection: Blocks malicious IPs and domains automatically.
Application Rules: Enables FQDN-based filtering for more precise control.
2. Performance Impact
Increased Latency: Traffic inspection may introduce delays.
Throughput Limits: Bandwidth depends on the selected firewall SKU.
3. Higher Costs
Charged per hour plus per GB of data processed, which may increase expenses.
4. Network Design Changes
Routing Adjustments: Requires configuring route tables and UDR.
On-Premises Integration: Needs proper routing for VPN or ExpressRoute connections.

1. Internal communication within the VNet
If all resources (such as virtual machines and databases) communicate within the same VNet or between peered VNets, the VNet’s NSG (Network Security Group) already provides traffic control. Therefore, there is no need to set up an additional Azure Firewall.

2. Accessing only Azure services without internet access
If your resources only access internal Azure services (like Azure Storage or Azure SQL) and you have enabled Service Endpoints or Private Link, external internet access to your resources is blocked. In this case, configuring a firewall is unnecessary.

5. Default-allowed outbound traffic
By default, Azure VNet allows all outbound traffic to the internet. If you don’t need to restrict outbound traffic or enable additional logging and monitoring features, there’s no need to configure an Azure Firewall.
